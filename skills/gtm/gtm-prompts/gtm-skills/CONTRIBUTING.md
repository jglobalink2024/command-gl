## Adding New Prompts

This is the core of GTM Skills, and we want to make it easy for you to contribute.

### What Makes a Great Prompt?

**Great prompts have:**

1. **Clear context** - Tell the AI who it is and what situation it's in
2. **Specific instructions** - Not vague asks, but concrete guidance
3. **Defined output format** - What should the response look like?
4. **Customizable variables** - Use `{{brackets}}` for parts that change
5. **Real-world testing** - Only submit prompts you've actually used

**Avoid:**

- Generic prompts that could apply to anything
- Prompts requiring proprietary or confidential data
- Copy-pasted content from other sources without attribution
- Overly complex prompts that try to do everything at once

### Prompt Template

Use this structure when adding prompts:

```markdown
## [Prompt Name]

[One-sentence description of what this prompt does]

**Use Case:** [When to use this]
**Role:** [SDR/AE/Manager/RevOps/CSM/Founder]
**Difficulty:** [Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced]

### Prompt

```
[Your prompt here]

Use {{variable_name}} for customizable parts.
Be specific about:
- What context to provide
- What output format you want
- Any constraints (word count, tone, etc.)
```

### Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `{{company_name}}` | Target company | "Acme Corp" |
| `{{prospect_role}}` | Contact's title | "VP of Sales" |

### Example Output

[Show what good output looks like - this helps users understand the prompt's value]

### Tips

[Optional: Pro tips for getting better results]

### Step-by-Step: Adding a Prompt

1. **Find the right location** - See [Directory Structure](#directory-structure) below
2. **Create or edit the file** - Use `kebab-case.md` for new files
3. **Follow the template** - Use the structure above
4. **Add horizontal rules** - Use `---` between prompts for readability
5. **Test it** - Make sure it works before submitting

## Style Guide

### Formatting Standards

| Element | Convention | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| File names | `kebab-case.md` | `cold-email-opener.md` |
| Directories | `kebab-case` | `cold-outreach/` |
| Variables | `{{snake_case}}` | `{{company_name}}` |
| Headers | Title Case | `## Discovery Questions` |
| Lists | Sentence case | `- First item here` |

### Markdown Best Practices

```markdown
# Use proper heading hierarchy
## Don't skip levels
### Like this

# Prompts go in code blocks
```
Your prompt here
```

# Use tables for structured info
| Column | Column |
|--------|--------|
| Data   | Data   |

# Separate prompts with horizontal rules
---
```

### Writing Tone

- **Professional but accessible** - Write for practitioners, not academics
- **Practical over theoretical** - Focus on what works, not what should work
- **Specific over generic** - "Write a 3-sentence email" not "Write an email"
- **Actionable over advisory** - Give people something they can use immediately

### Prompt Writing Best Practices

1. **Set the stage** - "You are an expert SDR who specializes in..."
2. **Be explicit about output** - Specify format, length, tone, structure
3. **Include constraints** - Word limits, things to avoid, required elements
4. **Use numbered lists** - For multi-part outputs, number what you want
5. **Provide context fields** - Create clear sections for user input

**Good example:**
```
Write a cold email under 75 words that:
1. Opens with a specific observation about their business
2. Connects to a problem we solve
3. Ends with a soft CTA (no meeting ask)

Tone: Conversational, peer-to-peer
Avoid: Generic compliments, "I hope this finds you well"
```

**Avoid:**
```
Write a good cold email that will get a response.
```

## Testing Requirements
