## Cold Email Principles

1. **Subject lines** - 3-5 words. Lowercase. Create curiosity.
2. **First line** - About THEM, not you. Observation or question.
3. **Body** - One idea. One paragraph. No fluff.
4. **CTA** - One clear ask. Make it easy to say yes.
5. **Length** - 50-75 words max. Respect their time.

## LinkedIn Post Principles

1. **Hook** - First line makes them stop scrolling
2. **Story** - Personal, specific, vulnerable
3. **Insight** - What you learned that they can use
4. **Format** - Short paragraphs. White space. Easy to scan.
5. **CTA** - Engagement question or clear next step

## Follow-up Principles

1. **Add value** - Don't just "check in"
2. **New angle** - Each touch has fresh info
3. **Shorter** - Follow-ups get progressively shorter
4. **Breakup** - Know when to exit gracefully

**The Number:** "Sarah, Jake. 47 days. That's the average ramp time with teams your size. Thought you'd want to know how. Call me."

**The Exit:** "Sarah, Jake. Last voicemail from me - I know when to take a hint. If ramp time ever keeps you up at night, you've got my number."
