It's amnesia.

—

Every AI sales tool I've tried has the same fatal flaw:

You have a great conversation with a prospect on Monday.
By Wednesday, the AI has zero memory of it.
You're starting from scratch every single time.

That's not augmentation. That's a liability.

—

I've been running sales agents differently.

Using Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot), my agents have persistent memory that survives across:
• Sessions
• Days
• Weeks
• Channels (WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack)

When I talk to a prospect, the agent remembers everything from every previous conversation.

—

How the memory system works:

Two layers of storage (plain Markdown files):

1. MEMORY.md - Long-term facts
   "John @ Acme: Series B, CFO needs to approve, budget cycle is Q2, concerned about integration complexity"

2. memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md - Daily logs
   "2024-01-29: Called John, discussed pricing, he's looping in their IT director, follow up next Thursday"

Both persist indefinitely. Both are searchable. Both load automatically.

—

The multi-channel piece is key for sales.

Start a conversation on WhatsApp.
Continue on Telegram.
The agent remembers both.

Session scope = "per-sender" means each prospect has their own persistent context.

No more "remind me what we discussed." The agent knows.

—

Before the AI's context window fills up, Moltbot does something clever:

It triggers an automatic "memory flush"—prompting the model to save important facts before summarizing old context.

Your prospect details are never lost.

I wrote up a full guide on configuring Moltbot for GTM agents:

      name: "AE Workflow Transformation",
      content: `I rebuilt how my AE team works.

Not with a new CRM.
Not with another sales tool.
With prompts.

Here's what I mean:

—

The average AE spends 30 minutes researching a single account.

They pull up LinkedIn. Scan the 10-K. Read some news articles. Try to find an angle.

Then they write an email that says "I noticed your company is growing..."

That's not personalization. That's wasted motion.

—

So I built a different system.

Three AI agents that handle the grunt work:

1. Research Agent - pulls data, identifies triggers, maps stakeholders
2. Personalization Agent - turns research into specific messaging
3. Execution Agent - manages sequences with human approval

The AE focuses on conversations. The agents handle the prep.

—

The prompts powering these agents?

I packaged them into an open-source library.

2,500+ prompts organized by:
• Industry (SaaS, FinTech, Healthcare, Manufacturing...)
• Role (SDR, AE, CSM, Sales Manager...)
• Workflow (Research, Outreach, Discovery, Negotiation...)

Every combination has tailored prompts.

—

Why give this away?

Because the prompts are the starting point, not the destination.

Your edge comes from:
• How you customize them to your ICP
• The iteration cycles you run
• The data you feed into them

The prompts just accelerate the starting line.

Same territory. Same product. Same quota.

The difference: she stopped doing research manually.

Here's the shift:

—

Before:
• 25 min researching each account
• Generic "personalization"
• 3-4 meetings per week
• Constant context switching

After:
• Research agent preps accounts overnight
• She reviews briefs in 2 minutes each
• Writes genuinely personalized outreach
• 12 meetings. Same effort.

—

The research agent isn't magic.

It's a prompt + data sources + structure.

It pulls:
• Recent news and funding
• Job postings (hiring = pain signals)
• 10-K mentions of strategic priorities
• LinkedIn for stakeholder mapping

Outputs a 1-page brief with actual sales angles.

—

I've open-sourced all the prompts behind this system.

2,500+ prompts for:
• Account research
• Personalization by industry
• Discovery questions
• Objection handling
• Follow-up sequences

Organized by role, industry, and workflow.

      title: "How I'm using persistent AI memory to actually remember prospects (Moltbot setup)",
      content: `Been experimenting with AI for sales workflows and the biggest limitation I kept hitting: memory.

Every tool forgets everything the moment you close the chat. Talk to a prospect Monday, by Wednesday the AI has zero context. You're basically starting fresh every time.

**The Solution: Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot)**

It's a messaging gateway that connects WhatsApp/Telegram/Discord/Slack to Claude (or other models), but the killer feature is persistent memory.

**How the memory works:**

Instead of RAM that disappears, it stores everything in Markdown files:

- \`MEMORY.md\` - Long-term facts about prospects (company context, pain points, deal stage, objections raised)
- \`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md\` - Daily conversation logs

Both files persist forever and auto-load at session start.

**Why this matters for sales:**

1. **Continuity** - "Last time you mentioned the CFO needed to approve this and budget was tight until Q2..." — that's not scripted, that's remembered

2. **Multi-channel** - Start convo on WhatsApp, continue on Telegram. Same memory.

3. **No manual notes** - The AI tracks deal details automatically

4. **Compaction safety** - Before context fills up, it auto-prompts the model to save important facts

**Key config for sales:**

\`\`\`json
{
  "session": {
    "scope": "per-sender"
  },
  "compaction": {
    "memoryFlush": { "enabled": true }
  }
}
\`\`\`

**I wrote up a full guide:**

gtm-skills.com/free-tools/moltbot

Covers memory architecture, multi-channel setup, sample config for sales agents.

**The project itself:**

molt.bot (install: \`npm install -g moltbot@latest\`)

      content: `I've been digging into Moltbot's memory architecture and wanted to share how it works for anyone building AI agents that need to remember things long-term.

**The Problem Moltbot Solves:**

Most AI tools have session-based memory that disappears when you close the chat. For use cases like sales, support, or personal assistants, you need persistence across days/weeks/months.

**How Moltbot Does Memory:**

**1. File-based storage (not RAM)**

Memory is stored as plain Markdown in your workspace:

\`\`\`
~/clawd/
├── MEMORY.md           # Long-term durable facts
└── memory/
    ├── 2024-01-28.md   # Yesterday's context
    └── 2024-01-29.md   # Today's notes
\`\`\`

At session start, it loads MEMORY.md + last 2 days of logs automatically.

**2. Semantic search (hybrid BM25 + vector)**

The system builds a semantic index over memory files:
- Vector embeddings for meaning-based search
- BM25 for exact keyword matching
- Default: 70% vector, 30% text weighting

You can search for concepts even if the wording is different.

**3. Auto memory flush before compaction**

When context approaches token limits, Moltbot triggers a silent turn prompting the model to save important memories before summarizing. Critical details don't get lost.

**4. Multi-channel persistence**

Memory is shared across WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, etc. Session scope can be:
- \`per-sender\` - each person has own context
- \`per-channel\` - shared context per channel
- \`global\` - one context for everything

**Full docs:** docs.molt.bot

**I wrote a guide on using this for sales/GTM agents specifically:** gtm-skills.com/free-tools/moltbot

Anyone else using file-based memory for AI agents? Curious about other approaches.`

      content: `Hey r/sales,

I've been building out an agentic workflow for my AE team and ended up creating a ton of prompts in the process. Figured I'd package them up and share.

**What it is:**

A library of 2,500+ prompts organized by:
- Industry (SaaS, FinTech, Healthcare, Manufacturing, etc.)
- Role (SDR, AE, CSM, Sales Manager, etc.)
- Workflow (Research, Cold Outreach, Discovery, Objection Handling, etc.)

Every combination has specific prompts. So "SaaS AE Discovery Questions" is different from "Healthcare AE Discovery Questions."

**Why I made it:**

I was tired of generic prompt libraries that had stuff like "Write a cold email" with no context. Real sales work is specific - the questions you ask a healthcare CIO are different from a SaaS CTO.

So I built prompts that account for industry pain points, buyer personas, and workflow stages.

**Examples:**

- Research prompts that pull specific data points per industry
- Cold email templates that reference industry-specific triggers
- Discovery questions tailored to different buyer types
- Objection handling for common pushbacks in each vertical

**How to use it:**

Browse: gtm-skills.com/prompts
GitHub: github.com/Prospeda/gtm-skills

MIT license - copy, modify, use however you want.

**What I'm looking for:**

Feedback, honestly. What's missing? What industries or workflows should I add?

If you use any of these, let me know what works and what doesn't.

      content: `Wanted to share a project I just finished.

**The concept:**

Instead of one page with "sales prompts," I built a system that generates unique pages for every combination of:
- 8 industries (SaaS, FinTech, Healthcare...)
- 6 roles (SDR, AE, CSM...)
- 6 workflows (Research, Outreach, Discovery...)

That's 288 unique pages, each with tailored prompts for that specific combination.

**Why this works better:**

"SaaS SDR Cold Outreach prompts" is a different need than "Healthcare AE Discovery prompts."

By generating specific pages, each one can:
- Reference industry-specific pain points
- Include role-appropriate language
- Match the workflow stage

**The stack:**

Next.js with dynamic routes + generateStaticParams().

**Results:**

- 420+ pages generated in 44 seconds
- Each page has unique, contextual prompts
- All indexed by Google
